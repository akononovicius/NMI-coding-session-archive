# Battery problem

Wireless mouse requires two batteries with at least some charge to work.
Assume that battery life times are exponentially distributed.  Given average
life time, Î¼, answer the following questions.

* What is the average operation time of a mouse?  Assume that we change both
  batteries as soon as mouse stops working.
* What is the distribution of the operation time?
* How much does the overall service (operation) time change if we would
  change just one battery, the one which has lost its charge?
* What if the distribution of battery life times would be normal instead of
  exponential?
