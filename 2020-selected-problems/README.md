# Selected problems from 2020

Some details are given below, but you could check [slides](./slides.pdf) or
[YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16JeTw1X0m8) for more
details.

## ETS 1-3: The box

Write a Matlab program that calculates mass of an aluminum box (hollow
cuboid) in kg. The user should be prompted to enter the external
measurements (height, width and length) of the box and the thickness of its
walls in meters. The program should print out the weight of the box in kg in
a nicely formatted sentence.

## ETS 1-5: Sum to one hundred
        
Write a Matlab program that outputs all possibilities to put `+`
or `-` or nothing between the numbers from 1 to 9 (in ascending order)
such that the result is some target number. The program should prompt
the user to enter the target number. For target number `100`, one
of the possibilities is:

```
    1+2+3-4+5+6+78+9=100.
```

## ETS 2-2: Gaussians

Let `X` be a standard Gaussian random variable (with zero mean and unit
variance).

* Estimate the probability that `X` is in `[-1, 1]`. Compare simulation and
  theoretical results.
* How does this probability depend on the mean?
* How does this probability depend on the standard deviation (variance)?
* What is the mean and standard deviation of `X.^2`. How do they depend on
  the mean and the standard deviation (variance) of $X$?
