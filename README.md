# Code produced during coding sessions

This repository serves as an archive for the code produced during the coding
sessions of the "Numerical Methods I" course taught at [Vilnius
University](https://www.vu.lt) [Faculty of Physics](https://www.ff.vu.lt/).
See the relevant folder for the code.

Usually the code is runable by running `main.m` script in a respective
folder.
